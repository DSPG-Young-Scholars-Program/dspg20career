      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

It ends up being a little tricky, but as long as you have created a folder to insert your images, you can just use some markdown code or html to insert images in the format you want.</description>

      <description>Exploring veteran&#39;s whole career sequences After cleaning the BGT data, we created our sequence objects using TraMineR. To begin, we created a sequence object using the whole career of veterans. This yielded 8,068 sequences of varying lengths. When creating the whole career sequence object, we defined eight unique states: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5, Missing zone, Military, and Unemployed.</description>

      <description>Transition Matrix Normalization There are nine levels of job state: job zone (level) 1, job zone (level) 2, job zone (level) 3, job zone (level) 4, job zone (level) 5, transitional unemployment, unemployment, unemployment or retirement, and unknown job zone.
Transition matrix is composed of transition rates between each pair of states. Transition matrix has dimension \(k \times k\), k being the number of job states, Since we have 9 job states, our transition matrix has dimension \(9 \times 9\).</description>

      <description>2020 Veteran Career Pathways Summer Project This project focuses on exploring the career pathways of Army veterans, observed using Burning Glass Technologies resume data. The team explores modeling techniques including sequence analysis and tournament models to classify resume data into a typology of career trajectories, and identify factors associated with career mobility. Initial modeling efforts are focused on resumes in the Washington Metropolitan area.
Project Goals Example text: We&amp;rsquo;re devising and assessing methods that make human populations more resilient not just during, but also before and after natural disasters.</description>

      <description>UVA Data Science for the Public Good Program The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is a summer immersive program held at the Biocomplexity Instituteâ€™s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.</description>
