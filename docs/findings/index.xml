      <description>Main Findings From our research, we have come to several major findings.
Data profiling, benchmarking, and exploration. 1. BGT resume data overrepresents young and white collar veterans. 
  Sequence analysis 2. While there is some evidence to support career mobility for veterans over the entire career, there is little evidence to support career mobility for veterans as a group in the first ten years after they exit the military.</description>

      <description> In order to better understand the Burning Glass resume data, particularly in the context of veterans in the DC metro area, we wanted to benchmark it against other veteran- and career-related datasets to understand any differences in the populations. For more details about the data sources used here, see the Data section.

      <description>Exploring veteran&#39;s whole career sequences After cleaning the BGT data, we created our sequence objects using TraMineR. To begin, we created a sequence object using the whole career of veterans. This yielded 8,068 sequences of varying lengths. When creating the whole career sequence object, we defined eight unique states: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5, Missing zone, Military, Military transition unemployment, Civilian unemployment, and Retired.</description>

      <description>In the previous Sequence Exploration, we introduced the following sequence state naming system, shown in Table 1.
 {&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;filter&#34;:&#34;none&#34;,&#34;data&#34;:[[&#34;Zone 1&#34;,&#34;Zone 2&#34;,&#34;Zone 3&#34;,&#34;Zone 4&#34;,&#34;Zone 5&#34;,&#34;Missing zone&#34;,&#34;Military&#34;,&#34;Unemployed&#34;,&#34;Military transition unemployed&#34;,&#34;Civilian unemployed&#34;,&#34;Retired&#34;],[&#34;Z1&#34;,&#34;Z2&#34;,&#34;Z3&#34;,&#34;Z4&#34;,&#34;Z5&#34;,&#34;MISSING&#34;,&#34;MILITARY&#34;,&#34;UNEMP&#34;,&#34;TR UNEMP&#34;,&#34;CV UNEMP&#34;,&#34;RETIRED&#34;],[&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;O*NET SOC Code&#34;,&#34;seqdef() gaps =&#34;,&#34;seqdef() left =&#34;,&#34;seqdef() gaps =&#34;,&#34;seqdef() right =&#34;],[&#34;Job Zones group occupations into one of five categories based on levels of education, experience, and training necessary to perform the occupation.</description>

      <title>Tournament Theory</title>

      <description>Tournament Theory Rosenbaum&#39;s (1979) tournament model (described in more detail in the Methodology section) argues that career mobility can be represented as rounds of a tournament, where each round has winners and losers and the results of each round affect subsequent career opportunities. We use 10-year career sequences of veterans beginning after their last military job to test hypotheses about career mobility.
We are particularly interested in two potential tournament &amp;quot;results&amp;quot; for veterans: early promotion (promotion within two years of leaving the military) and transitional unemployment (unemployment occurring directly after leaving the military).</description>
