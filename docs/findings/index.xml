      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

It ends up being a little tricky, but as long as you have created a folder to insert your images, you can just use some markdown code or html to insert images in the format you want.</description>

      <description>Exploring veteran&#39;s whole career sequences After cleaning the BGT data, we created our sequence objects using TraMineR. To begin, we created a sequence object using the whole career of veterans. This yielded 8,068 sequences of varying lengths. When creating the whole career sequence object, we defined eight unique states: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5, Missing zone, Military, Military transition unemployment, Civilian unemployment, and Retired.</description>

      <description>Transition Matrix There are nine levels of job state: job zone (level) 1, job zone (level) 2, job zone (level) 3, job zone (level) 4, job zone (level) 5, transitional unemployment, unemployment, unemployment or retirement, and unknown job zone.

      <title>Tournament Theory</title>

      <description>Tournament Theory Rosenbaum&#39;s (1979) tournament model (described in more detail in the Methodology section) argues that career mobility can be represented as rounds of a tournament, where each round has winners and losers and the results of each round affect subsequent career opportunities. We use 10-year career sequences of veterans beginning after their last military job to test hypotheses about career mobility.
We are particularly interested in two potential tournament &amp;quot;results&amp;quot; for veterans: early promotion (promotion within two years of leaving the military) and transitional unemployment (unemployment occurring directly after leaving the military).</description>
