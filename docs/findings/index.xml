      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

      <description>/* this chunnk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3 { text-align: center; }  Examples Page If you want to add in an image on an Rmd file, use this link here. It ends up being a little tricky, but as long as you have created a folder to insert your images, you can just use some markdown code or html to insert images in the format you want.</description>

      <description>Exploring veteran&#39;s whole career sequences After cleaning the BGT data, we created our sequence objects using TraMineR. To begin, we created a sequence object using the whole career of veterans. This yielded 8,068 sequences of varying lengths.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of career sequence lengths for veterans.
When defining the sequence object, we specified to exclude left and right gaps in the sequence. Looking at a whole career, left and right sequence gaps have no substantive meaning, since there cannot be career gaps before or after a career has started or ended.</description>

      <description>Transition Matrix Normalization There are nine levels of job state: job zone (level) 1, job zone (level) 2, job zone (level) 3, job zone (level) 4, job zone (level) 5, transitional unemployment, unemployment, unemployment or retirement, and unknown job zone.
Transition matrix is composed of transition rates between each pair of states. Transition matrix has dimension \(k \times k\), k being the number of job states, Since we have 9 job states, our transition matrix has dimension \(9 \times 9\).</description>
