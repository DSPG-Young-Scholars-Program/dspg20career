### 2020 Veteran Career Pathways Summer Project {style=text-align:center}

This project focuses on exploring the career pathways of Army veterans, observed using Burning Glass Technologies resume data. The team explores modeling techniques including sequence analysis and tournament models to classify resume data into a typology of career trajectories, and identify factors associated with career mobility. Initial modeling efforts are focused on resumes in the Washington Metropolitan area.

### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

As part of a larger project with the Army Research institute we seek to develop predictve models and metrics to describe the career pathways of veterans and active duty Soldiers. This can lead to new quantitative approaches to Army personnel planning and talent management.
