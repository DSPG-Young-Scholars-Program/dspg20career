### 2020 Veteran Career Pathways Summer Project {style=text-align:center}

This project focuses on exploring the career pathways of Army veterans, observed using Burning Glass Technologies resume data. The team explores modeling techniques including sequence analysis and tournament models to classify resume data into a typology of career trajectories, and identify factors associated with career mobility. Initial modeling efforts are focused on resumes in the Washington Metropolitan area.

### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

Example text: We're devising and assessing methods that make human populations more resilient not just during, but also before and after natural disasters. Among the topics we're studying are social isolation, social support structures, social vulnerability indices and various well-being indices.

### Our Approach {style=text-align:center}

Example text: We study damage-inducing mechanisms such as wind, rain, storm surge and flooding. We model their effects on damage to interacting networks - infrastructure and human networks. Our main priority is to understand the interactions among utility infrastructures and how they impact human life.
