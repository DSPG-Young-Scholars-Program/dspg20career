### Data Sources {style=text-align:center}

#### Burning Glass Technologies Resume Data {style=text-align:center}
[Burning Glass Technologies (BGT)](https://www.burning-glass.com/) provides data on resumes that were collected from publically available sites between 2016 AND 2018. This data includes information about an individual's education, certifications, skills, geographic location, and of course, job history. The information on job history includes its position on a resume, the dates the job was held, and the [O\*NET-SOC code] (https://www.onetonline.org/) of the job. O\*NET-SOC codes also correspond with [O\*NET job zones](https://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones), which are grouped based on the amount of preparation needed for a position. We subsetted this resume data to resumes in DC Metropolitan Statistical Area (DC MSA) with military career history (O\*NET-SOC code beginning with 55-).

#### American Community Survey {style=text-align:center}

The [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) is an ongoing yearly survey conducted by the U.S Census Bureau. ACS samples households to compile 1-year and 5-year datasets providing information on population sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including data on characteristics of the veteran population. We use ACS data to learn more about the demographic profile of veterans in the DC MSA.


#### Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) {style=text-align:center}

The [LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#lodes) data combine administrative and survey data to provide information about the labor market, employers, and workers. LODES data can be subsetted to the DC MSA, but is not specific to the veteran population. We use LODES data as a comparison to Burning Glass data on employment by industry.


#### Veteran Employment Outcomes (VEO) {style=text-align:center}

The [Veteran Employment Outcomes (VEO)](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/veo_experimental.html) data are new Census Bureau statistics on labor market outcomes for recent Army veterans. They present aggregated statistics for all Army veterans who have recently completed their term of service. This data is currently only available at the national level. We used VEO data as a comparison to Burning Glass data on veteran employment by industry.


#### Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) {style=text-align:center}

The [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm) is a survey conducted yearly by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). It is not specific to veteran status or the DC metro area, but includes variables on both. We used BRFSS data as a demographic comparison for veterans in the DC Metro Area.
