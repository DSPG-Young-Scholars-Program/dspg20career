### Main Findings 

From our research, we have come to several major findings.

#### Data profiling, benchmarking, and exploration.
##### 1. BGT resume data overrepresents young and white collar veterans.

#### Sequence analysis
##### 2. While there is some evidence to support career mobility for veterans over the entire career, there is little evidence to support career mobility for veterans as a group in the first ten years after they exit the military.

##### 3. Almost half of veterans are in a state of unemployment in the first and tenth years after they exit the military.

#### Clustering of sequences
##### 4. Sequence clusters characterized by a higher average job zone also contain more advanced degree earners.
##### 5. Female veterans are more likely to retire or to exit the work force after the conclusion of their military career.

#### Tournament theory hypothesis
##### 6. Promotion in the first two years after military exit affects later employment outcomes, being associated with future employment.
##### 7. Military transitional unemployment in the first two years after military exit affects later employment outcomes, being associated with future unemployment and finishing in a lower job zone.
