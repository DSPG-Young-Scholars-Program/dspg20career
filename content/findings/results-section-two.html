<h3>Exploring veteran's whole career sequences</h3>
<p>After cleaning the BGT data, we created our sequence objects using TraMineR. To begin, we created a sequence object using the whole career of veterans. This yielded 8,068 sequences of varying lengths. When creating the whole career sequence object, we defined eight unique states: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5, Missing zone, Military, and Unemployed.</p>

<p>When defining the sequence object, we specified to exclude left and right gaps in the sequence. Looking at a whole career, left and right sequence gaps have no substantive meaning, since there cannot be career gaps before or after a career has started or ended. Furthermore, because we were analyzing the entire career of veterans, we chose to include not only the five O NET job zones as job states, but also a separate state for military careers. Coding a military career state into the sequences allows us to contextualize subsequential sequence analysis of veterans after their last military job. We also included a state for missing O NET job zone so that it is not miscounted as unemployment.</p>
<p>Among the sequences in the whole careers sequence object, there was a large distribution in sequence length. Differing lengths in sequences makes it difficult to make comparisons between sequences, including computing distance and clustering.</p>

<p>Next, we visualized the sequences by looking at the mean time spent in each state. Interestingly, veterans spend the most time of their careers in Zone 4. Veterans are also spending a lot of time in Military careers. Also, veterans spend almost as much time unemployed as in Zone 5.</p>

<h3>Exploring first ten years after veteran's military exit sequences</h3>
<p>To begin answering our research question about veterans careers, we needed to subset our sample to only look at careers after veterans exit the military. Additionally, after this preliminary analysis and some clustering, we decided to subset again to only the first ten years of a veteran's post military career to combat problems associated with differing sequence lengths. Setting these new parameters yielded a sequence object with 5,185.</p>
<p>When defining the sequence object, we needed to reconsider the substantive interpretation of left and right career gaps. Because for this sequence object we are looking in the middle of a whole career sequence, gaps at the right and left of the sequence have substantive meaning. Right gaps indicate transitional unemployment, or a period of unemployment after a final military occupation and a subsequent job. Left gaps could mean either unemployment or a career exit. Furthermore, there are no military states to encode for this analysis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zone 4 is the least common state among veterans ten years after their military experience.</p>

<h3>Conclusions and Implications</h3>
<p>The intital exploration of sequences helped us to define and prioritize our research questions and project scope. By subsetting to the first ten years of a veteran's post military career, we are able to make more meaningful comparisons between sequences, which is necessary for cluster analysis.</p>
